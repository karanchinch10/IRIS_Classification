#  IRIS Flower Detection App
## Problem Statement:
To determine class or cateogry of flower which its belong to base on their 4 features such as sepal length,sepal width, petal length and petal width.

![Semantic description of image](flower.jpg "Image Title")
## Content:
Dataset has 5 ColumnsÂ¶
- Sepal length
- Sepal Width
- Petal length
- Petal Width
- Species has 3 categories(setosa,virginica,versicolor)
## My Work:
- I have made this model which will predict estimated price of old car base on thier features such as brand,KM drive,Power,Year and so on..
- I have done stepwise EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) then visualizatiion to get some idea about important features or correlation of each feature with output which dominates more to predict price
- Then I have done Feature Engineering which inclueds features extraction & features construction based on my domian knowledge and visualization followed by label encoding 
- I have train multiples ML models on same data in order to Analysed & compare performance of differents models based of accuracy and complexity
- I have used all regression algorithms to train model and after comparing I got well accuracy by RandomForestRegressor after cross validation which was around 90%
- Finally Build web application in python using streamlit library and then deploy the model 
- <https://karanchinch10-oldcar-sell-streamlit-app-p6gwqq.streamlitapp.com/> works too. Must be used for explicit links.
- Technical tools or library used --Python,numpy,pandas,sklearn,matplotllib,html,css,streamlit
